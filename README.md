# DeepSeek Harness

English | [中文](README.zh.md)

DeepSeek Harness (`dsh`) is an open-source agent harness developed by [DeepSeek AI](https://deepseek.com).

It uses an architecture where **everything is a plugin**, and is powered by [Cordis](https://github.com/cordiverse/cordis), whose design is described in [_A Programming Paradigm for Spatiotemporal Composability_](https://github.com/cordiverse/paper).

## Developer preview

DeepSeek Harness is currently in _developer preview_ and is iterating rapidly. **THERE WILL BE COMPATIBILITY-BREAKING CHANGES.**

## Run

### Windows desktop app

Download [deepseek harness.exe for Windows x64](https://github.com/DarrenHoo-10/oh-my-dsh/releases/download/v0.1.0-rc.5/deepseek%20harness.exe) and run the installer. The installer includes Electron and the Harness runtime, so Node.js and pnpm are not required.

On first launch, select a workspace and configure model-provider credentials in Settings. This developer-preview build is not code-signed, so Windows SmartScreen may display a warning; verify the release URL and SHA-256 checksum before continuing.

### Run from `npm`

Install `Node.js`, then run:

```sh
npx @deepseek-ai/dsh web
```

The command starts the Web UI, served at `http://127.0.0.1:3080` by default. See [Web UI guide](docs/user/guide/index.md).

### Run from source

To run from a repository checkout:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness.git
cd deepseek-harness
pnpm install
pnpm run build
pnpm dsh web
```
